# Project Progress

## Current Status

The app has been converted to a status bar app that runs in the background. The settings window only opens when the user selects "Settings..." from the status bar menu and closes when the window is closed. The fullscreen break view has a blurred background with transparency. The next break is now only scheduled after the current break is completed or skipped, preventing multiple break screens from appearing at start. All stored properties are now initialized correctly. The break window logic has been refactored into a BreakWindowController.

## Changes Made

*   Modified `TakeABreakApp.swift` to remove the `WindowGroup` and add a `StatusBarController`.
*   Created `StatusBarController.swift` to manage the status bar item and menu.
*   Modified `TimerViewModel.swift` (renamed to `BreakManager.swift`) to manage the break logic.
*   Modified `BreakView.swift` to include the `dismissAction` closure and update the UI.
*   Created `SettingsView.swift` for the settings window UI.
*   Removed `ContentView.swift`.
*   Updated `Settings.swift` to remove unused properties.
*   Corrected initialization order in `TakeABreakApp.swift` and `BreakManager.swift` to avoid errors.
*   Added a blurred background with transparency to the break view.
*   Implemented correct break scheduling logic.
*   Fixed the escaping autoclosure error in `StatusBarController.swift`.
    *   Refactored break window logic into `BreakWindowController`.

## Next Step Plan

1.  **Implement Settings Persistence:**
    *   Use `UserDefaults` to store and load the break interval and duration settings.
    *   Modify `SettingsView.swift` to save the settings when the user changes them.
    *   Modify `BreakManager.swift` to load the settings on app launch.

## Current Issues
* The app crashing issue has been resolved.
